			'Again I am raging, I am in such a state by your soul that every bond you bind, I break, by your soul. I am like heaven, like the moon, like a candle by your glow; I am all reason, all love, all soul, by your soul. My joy is of your doing, my hangover of your thorn; whatever side you turn your face, I turn mine, by your soul. I spoke in error; it is not surprising to speak in error in this state, for this moment I cannot tell cup from wine, by your soul. I am that madman in bonds who binds the "divs"; I, the madman, am a Solomon with the "divs", by your soul.',

			'It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon each other, to quarrel, become violent, and make a scene. The lover is even worse than a drunkard. I will tell you what love is: to enter a mine of gold. And what is that gold? The lover is a king above all kings, unafraid of death, not at all interested in a golden crown. The dervish has a pearl concealed under his patched cloak. Why should he go begging door to door?',

If I broke your bowl, I am drunk, my idol.I am drunk - leave me not from you hand to fall into danger. This is a newborn rule, a newly enacted decree - to shatter  glasses, and to fall upon the glassmaker!',

If the bodyâ€™s image has gone, await the image-maker; if the body is utterly ruined, become all soul.',

He is not sorrowful and anxious and seeking oblivion that I may beguile him with wine and a heavy measure.',
